## Tricks for Music Creation

1. **Choose Custom**: Always opt for custom settings when creating music to give you the most flexibility and control over your work.

2. **Write Lyrics with ChatGPT**:
   - **Initial Draft**: Use ChatGPT to write the initial draft of your lyrics.
   - **Refine the Lyrics**: Once you have a rough draft, use ChatGPT to refine the lyrics. Be as descriptive as possibleâ€”write the whole song yourself without worrying about rhyming.
   - **Finalize the Lyrics**: Let ChatGPT fix up and rhyme the lyrics for you, ensuring a polished final product.

3. **Explore Unique Genre Combinations**:
   - **Increase Uniqueness**: Try to create genre combinations that don't naturally happen in music. For example, combining metal rock with opera performances can create an interesting and unique sound.
   - **Experiment with Well-Known Combos**: Alternatively, experiment with well-known genre combinations such as 'pop' or 'EDM' to create something familiar yet fresh.

## Installing the Chrome Extension

1. **Download from GitHub**: If you don't have Git, download the extension as a ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repository).
   - Go to the GitHub page.
   - Click on the 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP'.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

2. **Install the Extension**:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable 'Developer mode' by toggling the switch at the top right.
   - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder where you extracted the extension files.
   - The extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome extensions bar.

## Using the Chrome Extension

1. **Download MP3 Files from Suno**:
   - Navigate to your playlist on Suno.com.
   - Click the 'Run' button on the Chrome extension.
   - The extension will download all the MP3 files from your playlist. Note: There's a known bug with WAV files, but the MP3 files are fine.

2. **Upload to DistroKid**:
   - Go to [DistroKid's upload page](https://distrokid.com/upload).
   - Run the Chrome extension again on this page.
   - The extension will automatically fill in some details, including the artist name (you can edit this if needed).
   - Drag and drop the downloaded MP3 files into the upload area.
   - Fill out the album title, album picture, and genre. The rest of the details should be pre-filled by the extension.

## Q Framework

The music creation process described here is just one small part of the media development system within the Q Framework. These services are integrated into a startup generation website called [Run It By Q](https://runitbyq.com/). If you are interested in building applications using various APIs, you can purchase access to the system on [Cyberdyne Robotic Systems](https://cyberdynerobotic.systems/) (under construction until Run It By Q is finished).

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll be able to create music on Suno.com, organize it into playlists, and seamlessly download and upload your music using a Chrome extension. Enjoy your music-making journey!
